# Carstens Lab Genetic Diversity Project

## PRELIMINARY ANALYSES 
### I) Buffalo et al. mitochondrial diversity
1. COI sequences were pulled from GenBank for each of the species in Buffalo et al.
  - Fasta files for each species are located in `Data/Buffalo_data/Unaligned_data`
2. Sequences were aligned using MAFFT 
  - Aligned fasta files (.afa) for each species are located in `Data/Buffalo_data/Aligned_data/Original`
  
**TO DO:**
1. Check species alignments for errors (reversecomp, parasitic sequences, gappy regions, etc.) 
  - Each person has been assigned a set of species alignments to check in the `Data/Buffalo_data/Aligned_data/Original` folder
    - You should find a folder with your name on it 
  - Check each alignment in your folder and make any edits necessary
    - Trim ends with less than 10 sequences
  - Upload the updated (clean) alignments to the `Data/Buffalo_data/Aligned_data/Clean` folder
